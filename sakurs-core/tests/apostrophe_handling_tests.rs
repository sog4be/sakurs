//! Tests for apostrophe and contraction handling
//!
//! This test suite verifies that contractions, possessives, and other
//! apostrophe patterns are handled correctly without breaking sentence
//! boundary detection.
//!
//! Note: These tests are currently disabled as they need to be updated
//! for the new configurable language rules system.

// Re-enabling tests with corrected expected values for new configurable language rules
