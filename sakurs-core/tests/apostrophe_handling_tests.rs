//! Tests for apostrophe and contraction handling

//! This test suite verifies that contractions, possessives, and other
//! apostrophe patterns are handled correctly without breaking sentence
//! boundary detection.

//! Note: These tests are currently disabled as they need to be updated

// Re-enabling tests with corrected expected values for new configurable language rules

// Known Limitation: James' Possessive Pattern
// ============================================
// The current implementation cannot distinguish between:
// 1. Possessive forms like "James' car"
// 2. Potential opening quotes like "He said 'hello'"
//
// This is because the apostrophe after 's' is ambiguous without
// contextual understanding. Most rule-based systems struggle with
// this pattern, and it typically requires ML-based approaches.
//
// See test_james_possessive_pattern() below for specific examples.
