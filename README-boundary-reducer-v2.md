# BoundaryReducerV2 Implementation

This branch contains the enhanced BoundaryReducerV2 implementation that was separated from the main domain/application refactoring PR to keep it focused.

## Features

- **Quote Suppression**: Language-aware suppression of boundaries inside quotes
- **Cross-chunk Validation**: Enhanced validation for boundaries at chunk edges  
- **Configurable Behavior**: Customizable suppression rules via `QuoteSuppressionConfig`

## Current Status

The implementation is complete but not yet integrated. The current codebase uses `BoundaryReducer` (v1) in:
- `application/strategies/sequential.rs`
- `application/strategies/parallel.rs`
- `application/unified_processor.rs`

## Future Work

To integrate BoundaryReducerV2:
1. Update all references from `BoundaryReducer` to `BoundaryReducerV2`
2. Pass `language_rules` to the reducer instances
3. Test performance impact
4. Consider making it configurable (v1 vs v2 selection)
