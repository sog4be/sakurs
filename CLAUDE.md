## Important Project Guidelines

Before making any changes, please review:
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Git workflow, branch naming, and development guidelines
- **.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - PR checklist and required information

When asked to create PRs or commits, always reference these documents to ensure compliance with project standards.

## Tech Stack
- Rust 1.81+ (workspace with 3 crates)
- Cargo workspace resolver = "2"
- Key dependencies: thiserror, serde, tracing
- Testing: criterion (benchmarks), proptest (property testing)

## Project Structure
- `sakurs-core/` - Core Rust library implementing Î”-Stack Monoid algorithm
- `sakurs-cli/` - Command-line interface for batch processing  
- `sakurs-py/` - Python bindings via PyO3
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system architecture and design decisions

## Commands
- `cargo build` - Build all workspace crates
- `cargo test` - Run all tests
- `cargo fmt` - Format code
- `cargo clippy` - Lint and catch common mistakes
- `cargo check` - Fast compilation check

## Code Style & Conventions
- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Use `thiserror` for error handling across crates
- Implement `Send + Sync` for parallel processing traits
- Add rustdoc comments for public APIs
- Use workspace dependencies for consistency

## Architecture Notes
- Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters pattern)
- Domain core implements mathematical monoid properties
- Language rules as pluggable traits
- Designed for true parallelism via rayon

## Development Workflow
- ALWAYS run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before commits
- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before modifying core algorithm
- Add tests for new functionality - both unit and property tests
- Benchmark performance-critical changes
- Follow branch naming conventions from CONTRIBUTING.md
- Use conventional commit format as described in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Pull Request Guidelines
When creating or helping with PRs:
1. Always use the PR template structure from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Ensure all checklist items are addressed
3. Follow the commit message conventions (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Include the AI attribution footer in commits:

## Git Workflow
- Branch from `main` for new features
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed Git workflow and examples
